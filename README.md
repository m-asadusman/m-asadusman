## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

An aspiring web developer passionate about creating user-friendly websites. Iâ€™ve been learning the fundamentals of web development, with a strong focus on HTML and CSS. These tools have helped me build responsive, aesthetically pleasing websites, and Iâ€™m excited to expand my skill set into JavaScript and beyond.

I love solving problems and using creativity to bring ideas to life online. Each project I work on is an opportunity to learn something new and refine my craft. This portfolio showcases my work so far and my journey into web development. Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on projects that push me to grow.
